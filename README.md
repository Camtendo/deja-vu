# deja-vu
Desktop application replay manager for OBS instant replays.

### What does it do?
Deja-Vu allows you to monitor when video buffers are written to a directory and saves them into "replay-slots", so that you can organize and rapidly select them. This should be used in tandem with OBS. The program can save as many slots as you have hard disk space.

### What's next?
+ ffmpeg integration
+ Connections with web-overlay
+ Thumbnails of replays
